        <p> Ripple is a blockchain-based digital payment network and protocol that uses its own cryptocurrency, XRP. Ripple's main focus is as a payment settlement asset exchange and remittance system, similar to the SWIFT system for international money and security transfers used by banks and financial intermediaries dealing across currencies.

        The token used for the cryptocurrency is premined and uses the ticker symbol XRP. Ripple is the name of the company and the network, and XRP is the cryptocurrency token. The purpose of XRP is to serve as an intermediate mechanism of exchange between two currencies or networksâ€”as a sort of temporary settlement layer denomination. Ripple was first released in 2012 and was co-founded by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb.12</p>
