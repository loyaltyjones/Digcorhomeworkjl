        <p>USD Coin (USDC) is an asset backed stablecoin whose value is pegged to the U.S. Dollar (USD). 
 

 Every USDC token in circulation is backed by $1 USD in cash or cash equivalents, such as short-term U.S. Treasury bonds held by regulated U.S. financial institutions. USDC has adopted the ERC-20 token standard, making it interoperable with all Ethereum-based applications. The token is now found on many other popular blockchains including Algorand, Solana and Tron. 
 
 The price predictability of USDC has allowed it to serve as a safe haven for cryptocurrency traders during periods of market volatility. USDC also enables a more efficient transaction of value in a stable digital currency across borders than has been the norm from traditional finance. 
 
 USDCâ€™s utility is underscored by its extensive ecosystem of holders and service providers such as decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto exchanges.</p>
