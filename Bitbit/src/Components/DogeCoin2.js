        <p>For most of its existence, Dogecoin was generally considered to be an amusing “memecoin” beloved by its community — but with relatively little value. That changed in 2021, as Dogecoin became one of the ten biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap — with a total value that has topped $20 billion, even though each individual coin is worth pennies (see the current price). 

        How is that possible? Because there’s a lot of Dogecoin in the world. Unlike Bitcoin, which is designed to be scarce and resistant to inflation, Dogecoin was created to be abundant. As of April 2024, there were more than 140 billion DOGE circulating, and miners produce another 10,000 every minute. (By contrast, there are fewer than 20 million bitcoin, and just 6.25 BTC are mined every ten or so minutes.) 

        Abundance is a key part of the idea — Dogecoin (pronounced “dohj coin”) was created as a funny, low-stakes Bitcoin alternative. As soon as it was launched in late 2013, it began attracting an enthusiastic online community that have used DOGE for everything from tipping strangers for good Reddit comments to helping send the Jamaican bobsled team to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

        It got a huge boost during the GameStop saga when retail traders banded together online in an effort to boost DOGE’s price and Elon Musk became the token’s highest-profile proponent. Over the years he’s tweeted about DOGE, did bits on it when he hosted "Saturday Night Live," and teased accepting it as payment for Teslas.</p>
